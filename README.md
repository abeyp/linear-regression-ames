# linear-regression-ames

This project is a personal learning progression with Kaggle's Competition Dataset: 

In these Jupyter notebooks, I start with :
* an initial exploratory data analysis to familiar myself with the data, then 
* a single linear regression machine learning model, and finally 
* a multiple linear regression machine learning model with Lasso Regression ($L_1$ Regularization).
