# Machine Learning with Linear Regression

First Machine Learning project using Linear Regression with the Ames Housing Dataset from the Kaggle Housing Advanced Regression Techniques. 

This project looks at house sale data from the Kaggle Housing Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

## Goal
My goals for this project are to develop some interesting visualizations in the Exploratory Data Analysis file to familiarize myself with the data and use machine learning to predict Sale Prices for homes.

Files included in this repo include: 
* Exploratory Data Analysis of the housing dataset 
* Simple Linear Regression analysis to perform a model with one dependent and explanatory variable
* Multile Linear Regression analysis with all possible variables given in dataset
